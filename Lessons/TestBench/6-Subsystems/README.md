# Lesson 6 - Subsystem Methods

Make methods in the `DriveSubsystem` class that return sensor values and run the motors, and then use them in [Robot.java](src/main/java/frc/robot/Robot.java).

# Hints:

<details><summary>How to make methods</summary>

- Write `public int myMethod(double number, String name){}` to create a method named `myMethod` that returns an `int`, and takes a `double` and a `String` as parameters. You can switch out the return type, name, and parameters based on the application. Keep in mind you can have `void` as the return type if you don't want any return value.
